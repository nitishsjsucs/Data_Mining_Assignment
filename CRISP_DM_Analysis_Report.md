## 2. Data Understanding

### 2.1 Dataset Overview

**Dataset Name:** spotify_tracks.csv  
**Total Records:** 6,301 tracks  
**Total Attributes:** 8 columns  
**Data Source:** Spotify API (inferred from structure)

### 2.2 Data Dictionary

| Column Name | Data Type | Description | Example Values |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| id | String | Unique Spotify track identifier | "7kr3xZk4yb3YSZ4VFtg2Qt" |
| name | String | Track title | "Acoustic", "Here Comes the Sun - Acoustic" |
| genre | String | Musical genre classification | "acoustic", "world-music" |
| artists | String | Artist(s) name(s) | "Billy Raffoul", "Molly Hocking, Bailey Rushlow" |
| album | String | Album name | "1975", "Here Comes the Sun (Acoustic)" |
| popularity | Integer | Spotify popularity score (0-100) | 58, 57, 42 |
| duration_ms | Integer | Track duration in milliseconds | 172199, 172202, 144786 |
| explicit | Boolean | Contains explicit content flag | False, True |

### 2.3 Initial Data Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Complete dataset with no missing values observed in sample
- Consistent data types across records
- Unique identifiers for each track
- Standardized boolean values for explicit content

**Potential Issues:**
- Genre field appears to have limited variety (observed: acoustic, world-music)
- Artist names may contain special characters or multiple artists
- Duration values need validation for reasonableness
- Popularity scores need distribution analysis

### 2.4 Data Distribution Analysis

**Preliminary Observations:**
- Dataset spans multiple genres (acoustic, world-music observed)
- Popularity scores range from 0-71 in sample data
- Duration varies significantly (62,928ms to 356,870ms in sample)
- Mix of explicit and non-explicit content

---

## 3. Data Preparation

### 3.1 Data Cleaning Strategy

**Missing Value Treatment:**
- Verify completeness across all 6,301 records
- Implement appropriate imputation strategies if needed
- Document any data quality issues

**Data Type Validation:**
- Ensure popularity is integer (0-100)
- Validate duration_ms is positive integer
- Confirm explicit is boolean
- Standardize string fields

**Outlier Detection:**
- Identify extreme duration values
- Flag unusual popularity scores
- Detect potential data entry errors

### 3.2 Feature Engineering

**Derived Features:**
- `duration_minutes`: Convert milliseconds to minutes
- `popularity_category`: Categorize popularity (Low: 0-33, Medium: 34-66, High: 67-100)
- `artist_count`: Count number of artists per track
- `title_length`: Character count of track name

**Encoding Strategies:**
- One-hot encoding for genre categories
- Label encoding for artists (if needed for modeling)
- Binary encoding for explicit content

### 3.3 Data Validation

**Business Rule Validation:**
- Duration should be between 30 seconds and 30 minutes
- Popularity scores should be 0-100
- Track names should not be empty
- Artist names should not be empty
